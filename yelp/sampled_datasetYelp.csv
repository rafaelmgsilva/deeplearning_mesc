The tuna was ordered medium rare and came out accordingly served with mashed potatoes and a veggie. No complaints here. Will definitely frequent again!,positive

"Really quite disappointed. The food was good but nothing worth what we paid for it. The meat (we ordered the rack of lamb and the duck two ways) definitely tasted frozen and not fresh. Even the vegetables on the sidr made the steamer bag of veggies from the supermarket seem more appealing. Great view, good service but not really where to go if you're seeking actual good, wow-worthy food. You can definitely find something better to make your $90+ bill feel worth it.",positive

Sams gas is usually near the lowest in the area and if you want to know what the price will be in the future just use my simple macro econometric formula I developed years ago. Go to Bloomberg TV or CNBC and look for the RBOB index. As of 10.29.15 it is 135.00. Add 40 to that and you get $1.75 per gallon. Wait 3 or 4 weeks and that will be the price!  And just to update you I predicted $1.67 before xmas and you got it!  But now it looks like we won't go below $1.65 in January 2016,positive

Horrible waiting time on a sunday. Took 3 hrs 20mins to see a doc n even longer waiting for prescription papers! No one checked in the waiting room to inform to delay even after I had to let them know I was dizzy. All I was told was to sit in the chair n wait !! Should not be called an urgent care if they are not able to comply with waiting time.  Also they rather see to patients who were nasty about waiting and let the rest just wait!! Rather go to an ER and just suffer till weekday to see doc.,negative

She never once pressured us to consider buying a home outside of our budget even when we wanted to. It was so reassuring to work with a Realtor that I could completely trust in knowing what I wanted and protecting my best interests. If you are in search of a Realtor to represent you as a buyer or seller, call Paige, she will help you out and take good care of you.",positive

This is a long tip but the $2/day parking lot between Florida and Marion is not really $2/day. Plan to spend at least $7/day. I'm guessing the $2/day rate is for daytime only. The woman I asked said you get about 12 hours for your $2 so if you plan to take the Megabus for an overnight trip add the parking cost in or get a ride. You can also utilize one of the park and rides around town.,negative

"Anthony has always done a terrific job waxing--professional, clean, and pain free (as pain free as chest and Brazilian for guys can be lol)! Highly recommend him--he does a great job all around. 

I believe the reviewer who didn't like the fact that Anthony was asking ""where to wax"" didn't realize it is just his approach--Anthony realizes brazilians for guys are tricky and that he needs our help to do it well. Expecting him to do it all himself is going to be more painful and inefficient!",positive

I stopped going to this salon on the 8th of January due to rash on the back of my arm. I went to a dermatologist and the rash was verified as ringworm.  I do not have children nor pets.

Also the majority of their beds are visible dirty inside and out. I sometimes had to wipe the bed down before I tanned.,negative

"Stopped at this neighborhood location for ""Taco Tuesday"" while we were on our way to a different place.  While the two tacos for $4 seemed like a good deal, they were odd tasting -- more like luke-warm fatty barbecue and soggy soft shells.  While the server was nice, and the french fries were good, and hot, the tacos at this place were borderline scary to eat.  Didn't try the tequila shots or margarita deal.  Wouldn't recommend Sto's.",positive

They don't have things written down and the technicians have heavy Vietnamese accents. It's hard to know what's going on but that's the trade off for late hours.",positive

As a fitness enthusiast/gym rat of many years I've done everything from the big box gyms to Crossfit.  This place has the best combination of offerings of any place I've been a regular.  Smallish size gives it a family-like feel. Spin classes are taught by real cyclists.  HIIT classes build power and strength a la Crossfit but in a safer and more sustainable way. And the best of all are the combo classes (O2) that give the gym its name.  I especially love the InCycle/InMotion combo.,positive
